0. Feature: Syllable Selection for Word Construction

Description:
In this mini-game, an image representing a simple word (e.g., a skateboard) will be displayed at the top of the screen. Below the image, there will be several rows of syllables arranged in a grid format. Each row will contain syllables with the same initial consonant, such as "La, Le, Li, Lo, Lu" or "Pa, Pe, Pi, Po, Pu."

The goal is for the child to select the correct syllables in sequence to form the word that matches the image. The rows will include both syllables that are part of the target word and distractors that are not.

For example, if the image shown is a skateboard ("patineta" in Spanish), the syllable rows might look like this:

Pa Pe Pi Po Pu
Ma Me Mi Mo Mu
La Le Li Lo Lu
Ta Te Ti To Tu
Na Ne Ni No Nu
Ca Ce Ci Co Cu
Da De Di Do Du
Functionality:

Syllable Selection:

The child must tap on the syllables in the correct order to spell out the word that matches the image (e.g., "Pa" -> "Ti" -> "Ne" -> "Ta" for "patineta").
Upon selecting the correct syllable, a sound will play, pronouncing the syllable, and it will be visually highlighted.
If an incorrect syllable is selected, gentle feedback will prompt the child to try again (e.g., a soft "oops" sound or a subtle visual cue).
Audio Feedback:

After successfully selecting the correct sequence of syllables to form the word, the app will play the complete word aloud (e.g., "Patineta").
The child can tap on the image at any time to hear the full word again.
Additional Features:

Randomization of syllable rows in each round to enhance replayability.
Positive reinforcement, such as animations or applause sounds, upon completing the word correctly.
Option to adjust difficulty by increasing the number of syllable rows or using longer words.
Educational Goals:

Reinforce syllable recognition and phonemic awareness.
Support early reading and word formation skills.
Encourage auditory discrimination by differentiating between correct and incorrect syllables.
This feature aims to provide a fun and engaging way for young learners to practice reading and constructing words, promoting both literacy and confidence in language skills.






1. Letter Matching Game
Description: Children see a variety of letters on the screen. A voice prompt asks them to find a specific letter (e.g., "Find the letter B"). The child taps on the correct letter to win.
Skills Targeted: Letter recognition, listening skills, hand-eye coordination.
Features:
Positive feedback (cheerful sounds, animations) for correct answers.
Gentle encouragement for incorrect attempts (e.g., "Try again!").
Increasing difficulty by adding more letters as the child progresses.
2. Phonics Pop
Description: Balloons float across the screen, each labeled with a letter or simple word. The app sounds out a letter or phoneme, and the child needs to pop the balloon with the corresponding sound.
Skills Targeted: Phonics, sound-letter association, fine motor skills.
Features:
Different levels with increasing speed or complexity.
Fun sound effects and visual rewards when the correct balloon is popped.
Option to replay sounds for additional practice.
3. Word Building Puzzle
Description: Children drag and drop letters to form simple words like "cat," "dog," or "sun." Each letter has a unique color or character to make it visually engaging.
Skills Targeted: Spelling, letter sequencing, vocabulary building.
Features:
Voice prompts that sound out each letter as it's placed, then read the full word once completed.
Animated characters or objects related to the word (e.g., a cat meowing when the word "cat" is spelled correctly).
Hints available if the child struggles, showing which letter to drag next.
4. Rhyming Words Match
Description: Cards appear face down on the screen. Children flip them over to find pairs of rhyming words (e.g., "hat" and "bat").
Skills Targeted: Rhyming, memory, and phonemic awareness.
Features:
Visual cues, like matching images, to assist children who are still learning to read.
Increasing complexity with more pairs and longer words as levels progress.
Time challenges or scoring systems to keep older children engaged.
5. Storytime Adventure
Description: Children choose a character and go on a short interactive story journey. Throughout the story, there are simple words to read, and the child has to tap on words that match the pictures shown.
Skills Targeted: Reading comprehension, vocabulary, listening.
Features:
Narration with highlighted text to follow along.
Interactive elements (e.g., tapping on a character to make them move or speak).
Multiple story paths, encouraging replayability and exploration.
6. Sound Sorting Game
Description: The screen is divided into two or three sections, each labeled with a different letter sound (e.g., "A," "B," "C"). Children are given images of objects (like an apple, ball, or cat) and need to drag them to the section that matches the starting sound.
Skills Targeted: Phonemic awareness, initial sounds, categorization.
Features:
Voice prompts to guide children ("Which section starts with the sound 'B'?").
Fun animations when an object is sorted correctly (e.g., the apple turns into a smiling character).
Increasing difficulty by adding more sounds or sections.
7. Tracing Letters
Description: Children trace letters on the screen with their finger, following a guided path that lights up as they go.
Skills Targeted: Letter formation, fine motor skills, handwriting preparation.
Features:
Visual and auditory cues to help guide the child's tracing.
Encouraging messages ("Great job! You traced the letter A!").
Option to switch between uppercase and lowercase letters.
8. Find the Missing Letter
Description: A simple word appears on the screen with one letter missing (e.g., "_at" for "cat"). Children are given a selection of letters to choose from and must drag the correct letter into place.
Skills Targeted: Spelling, letter recognition, problem-solving.
Features:
Hints available for younger children, like a faint outline of the missing letter.
Increasing difficulty by using longer words as the child advances.
Positive reinforcement with animations and sounds for correct answers.
9. Sing-Along ABC Songs

Interactive elements, like tapping on letters or images to hear their sounds.
Encouragement to repeat songs to reinforce letter recognition.
10. Treasure Hunt for Letters

Skills Targeted: Letter recognition, exploration, problem-solving.
Features:
Engaging storylines (e.g., "Help the pirate find the letter treasure").
Rewards like stickers or badges for finding all the letters.
New maps or themes to unlock, encouraging continued play.
